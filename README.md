# Noumea water quality map

This project intend to provide a very basic way to provide a map of water pollution.

It is fuly static and focus on the view (client side). You may fit it to your
own project by changing the way GeoJSON files are generated.

## How to use

The web part doesn't need any specific server, all the code lays in HTML/JS/CSS.

However, you need python if you want to run the data extraction from Noumea's
pdf files.
